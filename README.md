AutoVIML: Automating Machine Learning
Machine Learning provides the advantage of studying algorithms which improves automatically with experience. There are ’n’ numbers of machine learning algorithms and techniques and generally, we need to test most of them in order to find the best prediction model for our dataset which has the highest accuracy.
Most of the machine learning methods like regression techniques, classification techniques, and other models are defined in Sklearn but in order to select which technique is best for our problem statement or our dataset, we need to try out all these models along with hyperparameter tuning and find out the best performing model. This takes a lot of time and effort which can be reduced using a python package named AutoVIML.
# Installing AutoVIML
!pip install autoviml
# Importing AutoVIML
from autoviml.Auto_ViML import Auto_ViML
